# Resource_rings
This was a weekend project to display my computers (Ubuntu 20.04) CPU, RAM and GPU (NVIDIA) utilisation and temps on an external display, all the code and design files are available.
The project is powered by a Teensy 4.0 and uses four NeoPixel 16xRBG LED rings.
The display is designed to be mounted on the underside of a KOGAN 34" WQHD CURVED 21:9 ULTRAWIDE monitor.

You can check out the design and download the CAD at the link below

The code on the Teensy is an Arduino sketch, the code on the PC is Python.
